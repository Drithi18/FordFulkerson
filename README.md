# FordFulkerson
The program computes the max flow in flow networks read from an input file using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. It parses graphs, manages residual capacities, finds augmenting paths with BFS, and outputs details including graph structures and computed maximum flow. This implementation showcases network flow optimization using graph theory concepts.
